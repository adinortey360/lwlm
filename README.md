Lightweight Language Model (LLM) Documentation
Goal
The goal of this project is to create a Lightweight Language Model (LLM) that can run on small computers and phones, achieving performance comparable to GPT-1.

Architecture
1. Main Models
Train specialized models for different domains:

Basic language understanding
Specific domains (e.g., technology, medicine, finance)
2. Meta-Model
Train a meta-model to analyze input prompts and decide which main model(s) to invoke.

Model Interaction
1. Input Processing
User inputs a prompt.
Meta-model quickly analyzes the prompt to determine the appropriate domain or combination of domains.
2. Model Selection
Meta-model selects the main model(s) based on the prompt analysis.
3. Inference
Main model(s) generate outputs based on the input prompt.
4. Output Combination
Combine results from different models using a voting mechanism or weighted average.
Training Process
1. Main Models
Train each specialized model on a diverse dataset within its domain.
2. Meta-Model
Train the meta-model on a dataset of prompts with corresponding correct domain labels.
Model Integration
Integrate the trained models into a cohesive system where the meta-model guides the selection and combination of main models.

Testing and Optimization
Conduct extensive testing to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the LLM. Optimize the model selection and blending mechanisms based on performance metrics.

Future Improvements
Consider ongoing refinements, such as:

Continuous training to adapt to evolving language patterns.
Adding new specialized models for emerging domains.
Conclusion
The Lightweight Language Model aims to provide efficient and accurate language understanding across various domains, making it suitable for deployment on small computers and phones.
